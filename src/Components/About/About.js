        <p>
          I am a Copenhagen based Frontend Developer with a Bachelor's degree in
          computer science, living in Denmark for the past 9 years. With a
          passion for exploring, building, testing and maintaining simple and
          accessible user experiences, I look for ways to create tangible impact
          while learning throughout the process. Having 3+ years of diverse
          experience in frontend development, I possess a solid understanding of
          key concepts and also knowledgeable in backend technologies as well.
          As a people person, I am enthusiastic, curious to continuously learn
          and enrich the user experience with visually attractive, intuitive
          interfaces.

          I enjoy listening to music and reading Novels depicting the struggles
          of common people or fantasy novels. Occasionally, a bit of dancing
          with my friends and I believe in the importance of spending quality
          time with my family.
